### Install using the Binary Releases

Each release of kbcli includes various OSes and architectures. These binary versions can be manually downloaded and installed.

1. Download your desired [kbcli version](https://github.com/apecloud/kbcli/releases)
2. Unpack it (e.g. kbcli-linux-amd64-v0.5.2.tar.gz, kbcli-darwin-amd64-v0.5.2.tar.gz)
3. Move it to your desired location.
   * For Linux/macOS - `/usr/local/bin` or any other directory in your $PATH
   * For Windows, create a directory and add it to you System PATH. We recommend creating a `C:\Program Files\kbcli` directory and adding it to the PATH.

## Install KubeBlocks on your local machine

This guide walks you through the quickest way to get started with KubeBlocks, demonstrating how to create a demo environment (Playground) with one kbcli command.

### Prerequisites

Meet the following requirements for a smooth user experience:

* Minimum system requirements:
    * CPU: 4 cores, use `sysctl hw.physicalcpu` command to check CPU;
    * RAM: 4 GB, use `top -d` command to check memory.

* Make sure the following tools are installed on your laptop:
    * [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/): v20.10.5 (runc â‰¥ v1.0.0-rc93) or above;
    * [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl): it is used to interact with Kubernetes clusters;

### Initialize Playground

 ```bash
 kbcli playground init
 ```

 This command:
 1. Creates a Kubernetes cluster in the container with [K3d](https://k3d.io/v5.4.6/).
 2. Deploys KubeBlocks in the K3d cluster.
 3. Creates a standalone MySQL cluster.

 > NOTE: If you previously ran `kbcli playground init` and it failed, running it again may cause errors. Please run the `kbcli playground destroy` command first to clean up the environment, then run `kbcli playground init` again.

Check the MySQL cluster repeatedly until the status becomes `Running`.

```bash
kbcli cluster list
```

### Try KubeBlocks with Playground

View the database cluster list.

 ```bash
 kbcli cluster list
 ```

View the details of a specified database cluster, such as `STATUS`, `Endpoints`, `Topology`, `Images`.

 ```bash
 kbcli cluster describe mycluster
 ```

Wait until the status of this cluster is `Running`, run `kbcli cluster connect` to access a specified database cluster. For example,

 ```bash
 kbcli cluster connect mycluster
 ```

List and open the grafana dashboard.

 ```bash
 # list all dashboards
 kbcli dashboard list

 # open grafana dashboard
 kbcli dashboard open kubeblocks-grafana
 ```

### Destroy Playground

 ```bash
 kbcli playground destroy
 ```
