# kbcli

kbcli is a command line interface (CLI) tool for [KubeBlocks](https://github.com/apecloud/kubeblocks).

kbcli has the following features:
- Manage KubeBlocks, including installation, uninstallation, viewing status, and upgrading, etc.
- Manage clusters, including creating, deleting, configuration changes, backups and restores, etc.
- Support playgrounds to quickly experience KubeBlocks locally or on the cloud.

## What is KubeBlocks

KubeBlocks is an open-source, cloud-native data infrastructure designed to help application developers and platform engineers manage database and analytical workloads on Kubernetes. It is cloud-neutral with multiple cloud service providers supported, offering a unified and declarative approach to increase productivity in DevOps practices.

The name KubeBlocks is derived from Kubernetes and LEGO blocks, which indicates that building database and analytical workloads on Kubernetes can be both productive and enjoyable, like playing with construction toys. KubeBlocks combines the large-scale production experiences of top cloud service providers with enhanced usability and stability.

### Why you need KubeBlocks

Kubernetes has become the de facto standard for container orchestration. It manages an ever-increasing number of stateless workloads with the scalability and availability provided by ReplicaSet and the rollout and rollback capabilities provided by Deployment. However, managing stateful workloads poses great challenges for Kubernetes. Although StatefulSet provides stable persistent storage and unique network identifiers, these abilities are far from enough for complex stateful workloads.

To address these challenges, and solve the problem of complexity, KubeBlocks introduces ReplicationSet and ConsensusSet, with the following capabilities:

- Role-based update order reduces downtime caused by upgrading versions, scaling, and rebooting.
- Maintains the status of data replication and automatically repairs replication errors or delays.

### Goals

- Enhance stateful workloads on Kubernetes, being open-source and cloud-neutral.
- Manage data infrastructure without a high cognitive load of cloud computing, Kubernetes, and database knowledge.
- Reduce costs by only paying for the infrastructure and increasing the utilization of resources with flexible scheduling.
- Support the most popular RDBMS, NoSQL, streaming and analytical systems, and their bundled tools.
- Provide the most advanced user experience based on the concepts of IaC and GitOps.

### Key features

- Be compatible with AWS, GCP, Azure, and Alibaba Cloud.
- Supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB, Kafka, and more.
- Provides production-level performance, resilience, scalability, and observability.
- Simplifies day-2 operations, such as upgrading, scaling, monitoring, backup, and restore.
- Contains a powerful and intuitive command line tool.
- Sets up a full-stack, production-ready data infrastructure in minutes.

### Install using the Binary Releases

Each release of kbcli includes various OSes and architectures. These binary versions can be manually downloaded and installed.

1. Download your desired [kbcli version](https://github.com/apecloud/kbcli/releases)
2. Unpack it (e.g. kbcli-linux-amd64-v0.5.2.tar.gz, kbcli-darwin-amd64-v0.5.2.tar.gz)
3. Move it to your desired location.
   * For Linux/macOS - `/usr/local/bin` or any other directory in your $PATH
   * For Windows, create a directory and add it to you System PATH. We recommend creating a `C:\Program Files\kbcli` directory and adding it to the PATH.

## Install KubeBlocks on your local machine

This guide walks you through the quickest way to get started with KubeBlocks, demonstrating how to create a demo environment (Playground) with one kbcli command.

### Prerequisites

Meet the following requirements for a smooth user experience:

* Minimum system requirements:
    * CPU: 4 cores, use `sysctl hw.physicalcpu` command to check CPU;
    * RAM: 4 GB, use `top -d` command to check memory.

* Make sure the following tools are installed on your laptop:
    * [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/): v20.10.5 (runc â‰¥ v1.0.0-rc93) or above;
    * [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl): it is used to interact with Kubernetes clusters;

### Initialize Playground

 ```bash
 kbcli playground init
 ```

 This command:
 1. Creates a Kubernetes cluster in the container with [K3d](https://k3d.io/v5.4.6/).
 2. Deploys KubeBlocks in the K3d cluster.
 3. Creates a standalone MySQL cluster.

 > NOTE: If you previously ran `kbcli playground init` and it failed, running it again may cause errors. Please run the `kbcli playground destroy` command first to clean up the environment, then run `kbcli playground init` again.

Check the MySQL cluster repeatedly until the status becomes `Running`.

```bash
kbcli cluster list
```

### Try KubeBlocks with Playground

View the database cluster list.

 ```bash
 kbcli cluster list
 ```

View the details of a specified database cluster, such as `STATUS`, `Endpoints`, `Topology`, `Images`, and `Events`.

 ```bash
 kbcli cluster describe mycluster
 ```

Wait until the status of this cluster is `Running`, then run `kbcli cluster connect` to access a specified database cluster. For example,

 ```bash
 kbcli cluster connect mycluster
 ```

List and open the grafana dashboard.

 ```bash
 # list all dashboard
 kbcli dashboard list

 # open grafana dashboard
 kbcli dashboard open kubeblocks-grafana
 ```

### Destroy Playground

 ```bash
 kbcli playground destroy
 ```
