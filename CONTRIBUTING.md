## Workflow

Before contributing to kbcli go through the issues and pull requests, make sure you are familiar with GitHub and the [pull request workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow).

To submit a proposed change, read the following workflow:

### Open an issue

#### Check for existing issues

- Before you create a new issue, please search on the [open issues](https://github.com/apecloud/kbcli/issues) page to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed.
- If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments or add your [reaction](https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/).
- If you can not find your issue exists, [choose a specific issue type](https://github.com/apecloud/kbcli/issues/new/choose) and open a new issue.

#### Issue types

Currently, there are 4 types of issues:

- **Bug report**: Youâ€™ve found a bug with the code, and want to report or track the bug. Show more details, and let us know about an unexpected error, a crash, or an incorrect behavior.
- **Feature request**: Suggest a new feature. This allows feedback from others before the code is written.
- **Improvement request**: Suggest an improvement idea for this project. Use this issue type for document related improvements.
- **Report a security vulnerability**: Review our security policy first and then report a vulnerability.

### Setup kbcli

- Fork the kbcli repository to your GitHub account, create a new branch and clone to your host.
  - Branch naming style should match the pattern: `feature/|bugfix/|release/|hotfix/|support/|dependabot/`. kbcli performs a pull request check to verify the pull request branch name.
- Run `make kbcli` in your terminal to build kbcli. The binary is located in `.bin/kbcli`.
- To install [KubeBlocks](https://github.com/apecloud/kubeblocks) and play with `kbcli` prepare environment using this [guide](https://kubeblocks.io/docs/release-0.8/user_docs/installation/install-with-kbcli/install-kubeblocks-with-kbcli). 

### Using kbcli build

To check if the local changes made in the CLI are working as desired, perform the below steps:

- Run `make help` to check all available commands.
- Use `./bin/kbcli` instead of kbcli to perform tasks with your local build. For example - `./bin/kbcli --help`.
- Run `make test` to run all the tests.
- To run cases by module `go test ./path/to/your/module...`


#### Format the pull request title

The pull request title must follow the format outlined in the [conventional commits spec](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). Because kbcli squashes commits before merging branches, this means that the pull request title must conform to this format. kbcli performs a pull request check to verify the pull request title in case you forget.

The following are all good examples of pull request titles:

```shell
feat(apps): add foo bar baz feature
fix(kbcli): fix foo bar baz bug
chore: tidy up Makefile
docs: fix typos
```

#### Make sure CI checks passed

Wait for the CI process to finish and make sure all checks are green.

#### Wait for the code review finished

All pull requests should be reviewed and a pull request needs at least be approved by **two maintainers** before merging.

#### Merge to the main branch

All pull requests are squashed and merged. After the code review is finished, the pull request will be merged into the main branch.
